# Fig'oStore.html

This website is a double page with no responsive.

I made these pages during my training. The aim of this exercise is to use the buttons, the form, the flexbox and the inputs.

All the pages are statics, the cart page doesn't change with the product page

How to navigate :
- Product page :
  - All the buttons "Ajouter au panier" send to the cart page
- Cart page :
  - The title send to the product page
  - The bottom button "Continuer vos achats" send to the product page
